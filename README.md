# CNN Weather Classifier

This is a web application built with Flask that allows users to upload images of weather conditions and predicts the weather class using a trained convolutional neural network model.

## Getting Started

To get started with the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/qmjae/Weather-Classifier.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    cd weather-classifier
3. Install the required Python packages using  
    pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the Flask application:
    python app.py
5. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:5000 to access the application.

Usage
Upload an image of a weather condition using the provided form.
Click on the "Predict" button to see the predicted weather class and confidence levels.
Optionally, you can upload another image and make another prediction.
